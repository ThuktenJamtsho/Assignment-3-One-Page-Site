# ONE PAGE SITE
# BY U3166730
Welcome to the "Aboriginal Places in Canberra" one-page websit. This project is dedicated to shedding light on the rich cultural heritage of the Canberra region's Aboriginal communities. By exploring this site, you will embark on a journey to discover and appreciate the significance of various Aboriginal sites in this area. 

# TOPIC
From the examples provided, the best option for me was "Abroginal Places in ACT". Since this topic was an opportunity for me to learn more about the abroginal history and cultural heritage sites in Canberra.

Canberra and its surrounding regions are home to a multitude of culturally significant locations that hold immense historical value for the Aboriginal people. This one-page website serves as an educational resource and a platform for storytelling. Here, I aim to provide information about these sites, their cultural importance, and the stories they carry.

# MISSION
Increase awareness about Aboriginal heritage in Canberra.
- Educate visitors about the cultural and historical significance of specific locations.
- Promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the area's rich Aboriginal history.
- Encourage respect and responsible engagement with these sites.

# WEB PAGE DESIGN
In this design, I have created a simple, one-page website. I got carried away using code from open-source libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap. Looking back at the assignment question, I realized my mistake, but it was too late to rectify it.

# Comments on each section
# Heading and Nav bar
Both the heading and the nav bar turned out quite nice with the only issue being the nav bar doesnot blend as well as I would like with the rest of the page.

# Section 1 
These sections were designed to be simple banner or hearo sections, and here I used video background for better effects. 
They are meant as an introduction and conclusion to the project, tying the page together and being key informational sections.

# Section 2
In these sections, I created horizontal timeline design using CSS and HTML.
Leading to BACKGROUND & TIMELINE of ACTs

# Section 3 & 4 & 6
These sections have background color and effective information design with images.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my dedicated lecturer, Mr. Riley Post, for the Programming Design class. Mr. Post's unwavering support and guidance have been instrumental in my journey to learn the basics of programming and design. This was my first introduction to programming, and I had no prior knowledge of the subject when the course began.

As the course progressed, Mr. Post's clear explanations, engaging teaching style, and willingness to address questions and concerns proved to be invaluable. His dedication to fostering a creative and collaborative learning environment inspired me to push my boundaries and kindled my interest in exploring this field further.

I am genuinely thankful for the knowledge and skills I've gained under his guidance.
